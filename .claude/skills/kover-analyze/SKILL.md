Analyze Kover coverage report. Filter: $ARGUMENTS

## Process

### Step 1 — Generate XML report

Run `./gradlew koverXmlReport` to produce a JaCoCo-format XML report.

The report location: `build/reports/kover/xml/report.xml`

If the build fails, use `/debug-deps` to diagnose.

### Step 2 — Parse XML report

Read `build/reports/kover/xml/report.xml`. For each `<class>` element, extract LINE coverage from the `<counter type="LINE">` element:

```
coverage% = covered / (covered + missed) * 100
```

If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a module filter (e.g., `:network`), only include classes whose package matches that module.

### Step 3 — Classify classes

Classify each class into one of these categories using pattern matching (check in order — first match wins):

| Category | Pattern | Testable? | Target |
|----------|---------|-----------|--------|
| Generated | `*.generated.resources.*`, `*BuildConfig*` | EXCLUDE | — |
| Screen/Preview | `*Screen*`, `*Preview*`, `*ComposableSingletons*` | EXCLUDE | — |
| DI/Navigation | `com.nutrisport.di.*`, `com.nutrisport.navigation.*` | EXCLUDE | — |
| Database | `com.nutrisport.database.*` | EXCLUDE | — |
| Analytics | `com.nutrisport.analytics.*` | EXCLUDE | — |
| Component | `*.component.*` | EXCLUDE | — |
| DTO | `*Dto`, `*.dto.*` | EXCLUDE | — |
| UI Model | `*Ui` (in `feature` package) | EXCLUDE | — |
| Domain Model | `*.shared.domain.*` (data class, no logic) | EXCLUDE | — |
| ViewModel | `*ViewModel*` | TEST | 80%+ |
| UseCase | `*UseCase*`, `*.usecase.*` | TEST | 90%+ |
| Repository | `*Repository*`, `*RepositoryImpl*` | TEST | 70%+ |
| Mapper | `*Mapper*`, `*.mapper.*` | TEST | 90%+ |
| Utils | `*.shared.util.*` | TEST | 90%+ |
| Other | everything else | REVIEW | — |

### Step 4 — Output report

Generate a report with 4 sections:

#### A) Summary

Table of testable categories with current vs target coverage:

```
| Category   | Classes | Current | Target | Status |
|------------|---------|---------|--------|--------|
| ViewModel  | 5       | 62%     | 80%    | BELOW  |
| UseCase    | 7       | 88%     | 90%    | BELOW  |
| Repository | 4       | 71%     | 70%    | OK     |
| Mapper     | 3       | 95%     | 90%    | OK     |
| Utils      | 2       | 85%     | 90%    | BELOW  |
```

#### B) Priority Targets (top 10)

List the 10 testable classes with the largest gap between current and target coverage. Sort by priority: Repository > ViewModel > Mapper > UseCase > Utils.

For each class show: name, category, current%, target%, gap, suggested action.

#### C) New excludes

List classes that Kover currently tracks but should be excluded (matched EXCLUDE categories above but NOT in the current excludes block in `build.gradle.kts:40-58`).

Group by category. Show the glob pattern needed to exclude them.

#### D) Ready `excludes` block

Merge existing excludes from `build.gradle.kts:40-58` with new patterns from section C. Output a complete `classes(...)` block ready to copy-paste into `build.gradle.kts`.

### Step 5 — Suggest action

Based on the report:
- If there are classes below target → suggest `/gen-test <ClassName>` for the top priority class
- If there are new excludes → suggest updating `build.gradle.kts` excludes block
- If all targets met → congratulate and suggest raising thresholds

## Key rules

- **XML, not HTML** — JaCoCo XML has stable schema with `missed`/`covered` counters
- **LINE coverage** — instruction coverage is inflated by Kotlin compiler; line = what developer sees
- **Read-only** — never modify `build.gradle.kts`, only recommend changes
- **Current excludes** are in `build.gradle.kts:40-58` — always merge with them, never replace
- Coverage targets come from `.claude/rules/testing.md`: ViewModel 80%, Repository 70%, Mapper 90%, Utils 90%
- UseCase target: 90% (pure logic)
